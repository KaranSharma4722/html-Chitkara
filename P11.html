        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create webpages. It structures content by using tags, which tell the browser how to display text, images, and other elements. Each HTML document starts with the !DOCTYPE html declaration and contains a series of tags like html, head, and body. HTML is essential for web development, acting as the foundation upon which websites are built.

        HTML uses tags to define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags are written inside angle brackets, like p for paragraphs or h1 for headings. Most tags have opening and closing forms, with content placed in between. For instance, b Hellob makes "Hello" bold. Some tags, like  and br , are self-closing. These tags work together to create structured and interactive webpages.

        HTML allows you to create hyperlinks using the  tag, enabling users to navigate between pages. A hyperlink contains two parts: the visible text or image and the destination URL, defined by the href attribute. For example, Visit Example creates a clickable link that redirects to "example.com." Hyperlinks are a key feature of HTML, allowing websites to connect and form the web itself.

        Forms in HTML allow users to input data, which can be sent to a server for processing. A form is created using the  tag, with various input elements like, and  For example, creates a text field. Forms often include action attributes that specify where data should be sent and method attributes defining how the data is transferred (e.g., GET or POST).
